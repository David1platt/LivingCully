                  <br><br>She was born in a cave behind a waterfall. After being abandoned by her human family at the age of five she was adopted by a family of Pileated Woodpeckers who taught her the art of carving wood and eating bugs. As an act of rebellious independence Audie left the dead tree she had for years called her home to try city life on. Now she lives in her Northeast Portland home eating bugs and selling art under the name of Bear's Head Arts.
