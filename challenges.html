                    <h1><b>Challenges Artists Face</b></h1>
                    <blockquote><span style="font-size: 36px;"><b>Serena Blossom Apel, founder of Artists Union 503</span></b> <h4>Originally from Illinois, moved to North Portland over 10 years ago. Currently living in St John’s. </h4></blockquote>
                    <h3>"There used to be more options for places to display and sell artwork. First Thursday in the Pearl District used to be free for artists, but after gaining popularity, the city sought to make a profit and started requiring artist fees. Artists tend to thrive in areas that are populated with small local community businesses that offer consignment opportunities such as coffee shops, galleries and craft stores. When corporate entities replace small local businesses, the rent of those spaces increase. When that happens, artists have to pay a higher fee as well. More local artists need to be included in local mural projects. This provides a positive outlet and sense of pride within the community. Locally owned businesses are always more likely to work more with artists like Goodfoot Pub Lounge. Luckily there is still Last Thursday on Alberta that is free registration for artists.”</h3><br>

                    <h3>“Last Thursday is a community grown event, free to all artists and art vendors, musicians, performers & visitors. Artists, musicians and performers line the street from 15th through 30th Ave.s, galleries hold their monthly openings and restaurants and bars hang new artwork for sale. Last Thursday is the largest art event in Portland as well as the most entertaining place to buy local art.”</h3><br>

                    <h4>an affordable housing community for creatives, developed for working artists of all disciplines.</h4></blockquote>
                    <h3> “Having affordable housing and the space to practice your art is so important. Often times artists struggle with not having enough space or transporting their supplies back and forth to studios which can be difficult if you are relying on public transportation or rides from others.”</h3><br>
