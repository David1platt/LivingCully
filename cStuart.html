            <p class="profileTxt inset-text">Carolyn Stuart has been a passionate teacher and performer of Contact Improvisation since 1984. C.I. is a dance form that has been around since the early 70’s. It invites participants to explore moving while in physical contact with a partner. It’s been called a moving meditation, an art-sport, and affectionate wrestling. The practice is informed by one directive- to take care of yourself first. Because it is improvised, there are no rules. It operates by cultivating awareness and response ability in the here and now. It is an opportunity for experience and grow in a new paradigm of mutual well-being!
            <br><br>All are welcome, as each begins where they are, and develops from there. C.I. is a lifelong unfolding of what it means to simultaneously enjoy connection and freedom!
            <br><br>Contact Improvisation sessions occur weekly at Gracewood Studio in the Cully neighborhood. Carolyn Stuart and Patrick Gracewood host the sessions. They have been C.I. dance partners for 30 years, and enjoy introducing others to this radical, yet very natural way of relating.
