                    <p class="profileTxt inset-text">Jude Cornwell is a Cully fibre artist drawing influences from the folklore of Middle Eastern, African, and Celtic cultural studies. She has a formal education in clothing design. Jude works with a wide range of motifs, designs, and colors, “Folk observe my work with puzzlement, then delight, enjoying the cross-cultural effect of my fibre collage… Perhaps I’m trying to create a little global harmony in fabric!”
                    <br><br>Jude’s process often involves recycling, using collections of fabric and other supplies in unexpected ways. Jude describes her work as creating, “islands of colors and motifs” that she will continue to re-work until she is satisfied with a final vibrant combination of color, design and texture that speak to a unique multi-cultural aesthetical vision.   
                    <br><br>Cornwell runs a fibre arts classes at Grace Art Institute throughout the summer term, and was a board member of the West Linn Arts Festival for three years. She is a member of the Portland Handweavers Guild, and has been active in the Local 14 women’s art league for over 33 years.
