            <p class="profileTxt inset-text">Loretta Guzman runs the only Native-American-owned coffee shop in Portland. At Bison Coffeehouse, you will be surrounded by native tribal art, delicious fresh-made pastries and bagels from Bowery Bagels, Either/Or’s Tanglewood Chai and coffee supplied locally from Heart Coffee Roasters, and Tribal Grounds, a Native-owned roaster in North Carolina.
                <br><br>Loretta’s native heritage is reflected at Bison Coffeehouse in a positive and informative manner. Hosted artwork represents native artists from across the United States. A rack of Sho-Ban News newspapers sits up front next to the counter while Native American sculptures and stencils decorate the walls. “Every piece has different meanings for how they represent our people. It’s us, family, ancestors; it’s who we are.” By helping revive this beautiful 1926 building in the Cully Neighborhood, Loretta has been able to give local residents a place of their own.
                <br><br>Since the opening of this space, Bison Coffeehouse has successfully evolved into a valuable local meeting place, as well as a space which hosts an array of events, which include: Native American Poet nights, Coffee With A Cop meet-ups, holiday visits with Native American Solte Santa and other local events in alliance with the Native American Youth and Family Center.
