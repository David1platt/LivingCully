            <h2>Portland State University seniors: Christian Proctor, David Platt, Saman Sobhani, and Shay Bumbray have spent ten weeks learning about the factors involved in development without displacement in America with a special focus on the city of Portland, OR. Our main focus has been to understand the infrastructure of market driven development projects that change the diversity of poor neighborhoods. Neighborhoods that were once purposely neglected by city officials, are now being transformed into more desirable places that attract affluent families. In most cases people of color are excluded. These populations with higher levels of income have much more financial stability, which allows them to keep up with the increasing expense of living in an evolving neighborhood. This is formally recognized as gentrification. </h3><br>

            <h2>Throughout the term we have come to understand the true effects of gentrification, and how it, more times than not, displaces people that have lived in developing neighborhoods for generations. Instead of gentrification that displaces, we advocate for revitalization, an approach that is more community oriented which addresses economic and demographic shifts. Revitalization allows communities to maintain their diverse character to continue empower area residents. This is done to provide more support for local businesses as well as homeowners. but most importantly to avoid displacement.</h2><br>

            <h2>In collaboration with Living Cully, we have started an outreach program in the Cully neighborhood to find out more about the artistic history of the area. Our collected efforts have been used to create a catalog that represents some of the artistic values and desires in the community. It is our hope that this information can be used to continue to expand the artistic and cultural values of all people in Cully.</h2><br>
