        <p class="profileTxt inset-text">Mary Topagna graduated from the Art Academy of Cinncinnati with a BFA in Photography. She moved to Portland in 1991, and worked as a freelance photographer for The Oregonian. Over time Topagna slowly transitioned into exhibiting mosaic art pieces, and taking on a number of large and small commissioned projects.
        <br><br>Mary operated a storefront/gallery for 12 years off of 29th and Killingsworth until operating costs became to expensive. Now she maintains a private gallery/workspace. Her mosaic works cover a broad range of secular and religious portraiture. Her work also includes a number of ornamental objects ranging from crosses and rosaries to tables and lamps. These art objects are created using a number of interesting found and recycled materials to create detailed designs and imagery based on striking photography.
        <br><br>Tapognaâ€™s mosaics have been installed across the Portland metro area in locations ranging from McMenammins Kennedy School hotel to the Max Kenton light rail platform, and Maryville Nursing Home in Beaverton. Here works have been reviewed in a number of publications such as Urbanartnetwork.org, The Oregonian, Catholic Sentinel, and Artweek.
