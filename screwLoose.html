                    <p class="profileTxt inset-text" style="opacity: 0.8">Cleo and Kayin Talton Davis owners of Screw Loose Studio located on 3910 N Williams Ave is one of the last Black owned properties in their urban renewal area of Williams Ave. Together Soapbox Theory and Screw Loose Studio do custom design, screen-printing, stickers, posters, and banners. Their focus is on putting out positive and inspiring images of African American culture.
                    <br><br>Cleo and Kayin come from families that remember the thriving predominately African American neighborhood of Albina and have witnessed the the gentrification firsthand. Cleo’s family members, people that have been in Portland for over 50 years remnants of the days where Albina was a self sufficient thriving community where people felt safe, everyone knew each other, and local businesses were thriving.
                    <br><br>Cleo’s vision is to have more art throughout NE Portland that tells a story of the people that have been displaced and includes positive representation of the African American culture from the neighborhood, regardless if the neighborhood’s population is no longer predominantly African American. Their goals, in coalition with the Historic Black Williams Projects are to create trails that feature tiles of art either alongside on poles or on the ground paths, similar to the Walk of Fame in hollywood, CA.
