                <h3>“Art is so important for telling a story. We envision more art throughout NE Portland that tells the stories of the people that have been displaced and includes positive representation of the African American culture from the neighborhood, regardless if the neighborhood’s population is no longer predominantly African American. Our goals, in coalition with the Historic Black Williams Projects are to create trails that feature tiles of art either alongside on poles or on the ground paths, similar to the Walk of Fame in hollywood, CA. Along with tiles, we want to place  kiosks around the neighborhood that allows people to enter their input about art ideas. This would be an effective tool for capturing the stories of people from the neighborhood, past and present.” </h3><br>
                <blockquote><span style="font-size: 36px;"><b>Cully Residents</b></blockquote>
                <h3>"That's what these kids need, they need something... whether a place to express themselves, somrthing to join so they are just not on the streets."</h3>
                <h3>"My kids love art, any kind of art."</h3>
                <h3>"Involve kids and families we need more family structured things."</h3>

                <h3>"Given the diverse community in Cully, art programs for children would make the greatest impact. The programs would engage, educate, and create future audience for the arts."</h3>

                <h3>"Well in terms of current artists still living there, I don't know that I can think of anyone offhand, since sadly we've almost all been displaced."
                <br><br>
                "Nash's old spot on Wygant definitely housed a bunch of experimental artists over the years, Shane McDonnell, David Weinberg, Andy Brack, myself, probably some others. And then Ian and Laura were up there on Going..."
                <br><br>
                "There was also Wyatt's house, though that was further down on 39th and Shaver, which definitely doesn't count as Cully, but they were in the neighborhood and part of that little community.
                Man, I'm gettin all misty eyed and nostalgic thinking about those days, how sad that everyone mostly got pushed out!"</h3>
